# VLSI-AI-Project-From-Wrire-Length-Predictor-Model-to-Public-Web-App
This project started by using Linear Regression to predict VLSI chip metrics like wire length. It was then enhanced by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze error logs. The final web app acts as a powerful AI assistant, providing simplified explanations and fixes for complex VLSI issues.
